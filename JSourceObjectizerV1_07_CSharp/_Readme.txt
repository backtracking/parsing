    lib

        This directory contains all the libraries needed to use the JSourceObjectizer
        and the JSourceObjectizer itself:

            antlr-3.3-complete.jar

                The JSourceObjectizer uses a parser generated by ANTRL to parse Java 
                sources.

            HSDCoreLibrary2011.06.16.jar

                Don't worry about the content of this library. It's just a start of 
                centralizing most common things that are independent of a certain
                program (for instance: again and again used constants, messages 
                and so on).

            HSDJSourceObjectizerV2.00Alpha.jar

                This library contains the JSourceObjectizer itself.
